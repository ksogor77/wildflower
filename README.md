# Wildflower
I created Wildflower as a community building space for lgbtq+ teens and young adults.  There are resource pages for youth, parents and educators alike.  There is a blog space for users to share their own stories and connect with others.  The vision of Wildflower is to spread the feeling that we are all beautiful and perfect in our own uniqueness and to create a safe space for those in need of it.
